It's connect four.

## Installation and Startup
You'll need to download the phaser library so type this:
```
npm install
```

Then you can start a local server using npm's http-server, which you will need to install globally.
If you haven't done so, use this:
```
npm install --global http-server
```
Go into this project's root folder and start up the server.
```
http-server
```
